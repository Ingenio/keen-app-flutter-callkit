/// You donâ€™t instantiate [FCXCall] objects directly.
/// Instead, [FCXCall] objects are created by the telephony provider
/// when an incoming call is received or an outgoing call is initiated.
///
/// Each [FCXCall] object is uniquely identified by a [uuid].
/// You primarily interact with calls by passing their unique identifiers
/// to Flutter CallKit APIs.
///
/// For example, to place a call on hold, you create an instance
/// of [FCXSetHeldCallAction] passing the uuid of the call and true,
/// and then pass the transaction to an instance of [FCXCallController]
/// using the [FCXCallController.requestTransactionWithAction].
///
/// You can use the [FCXCallObserver] managed by a [FCXCallController]
/// to access [FCXCall] instances for active calls
/// using the [FCXCallObserver.getCalls],
/// or provide a [FCXCallChanged] callback to the [FCXCallObserver].
